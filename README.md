# Fiber-RADGET
## Introduction
Fiber-RADGET is a distributed fiber optic sensor structured on a spiral film to sense underground strain in response to plant root growth. This repository stores sample data, signal processing, and plant visualization codes written in MATLAB.
## Sample data description
- FiberInfo: each file contains ```gages``` an array of indices for gages of a distributed fiber optic sensor corresponding to the following positions in a Fiber-RADGET device
<img src="./Sample/Figures/config.png" width=50% height=50%>
- Abiotic: Real-time measurements of microstrains for every fiber optic sensor gage. The measurement was taken twice every second while a metal wire was penetrated at the center of a pot filled with glass beads or soil.\\
- Plants: Real-time measurements of microstrains for every fiber optic sensor gage. The measurement was taken twice every 2 minutes while a plant seed was sown at the center of a pot filled with soil at time 0.
